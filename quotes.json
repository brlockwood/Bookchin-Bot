  {
    "quote": "In our aversion to a form of reason that seems to render us insensitive and unfeeling, we may easily opt for a cloudy intuitionism and mysticism that can make our world outlook arbitrary and potentially dangerous.",

  {
    "quote": "Indeed, with the extension of suburbs into nearby open land on and unprecedented scale, the city seems to be literally engulfing the agrarian and natural worlds, absorbing adjacent towns and villages into sprawling metropolitan entities—a form of social canniablism that could easily serve for our very definition of urbanization.",

  {
    "quote": "To the degree that workers, vocational students, and high school students link their lifestyles to various aspects of the anarchic youth culture, to that degree will the proletariat be transformed from a force for the conservation of the established order into a force for revolution.",

  {
    "quote": "Vital as the idea of 'interconnectedness' may be, it has often been the basis of myths and supernatural beliefs that became a means for social control and political manipulation.",

  {
    "quote": "Feeling, sentiment, and a moral outlook we surely need if instrumental or analytical reason are not to divest us of our passion for truth. But myths, mind-numbing rituals, and charasmatic personalities can rob us of the critical faculties that thought provides.",
